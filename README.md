Goal:
To recreate (from memory) a Power BI dashboard I previously made while at my last job.

Purpose:
To streamline Jira reporting rather than manually extracting JQL filters and uploading them to Excel and further formatting.

How It Works:
The dashboard works by consuming JSON data via the Atlassian Jira API.
